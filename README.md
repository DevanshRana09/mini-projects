# Mini Projects Collection

This repository is a collection of small Python projects and coding exercises created while learning programming, data handling, and problem-solving. Each folder contains a project with a brief explanation and runnable code.

## Projects

- **Birthday Analyzer** â€“ Count people with the same birthdays from a CSV dataset and sort by date or number of people.
- More projects will be added as I continue learning and experimenting.

## How to Run

Each project folder contains instructions in its `README.md` or comments in the code. Clone the repository and run the Python scripts using:

```bash
python <script_name>.py
